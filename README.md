# Oliver's Handbook

As I have a sporadic mind and shifting interests, disorganization is most certainly the fateful future of any other traditional modes of recording keeping, so rather than having loose paper here and there, I have decided to consolidate all that I known, learned, and done into a single location. Thus, the site within this repository is effectively my brain dump as well as a more organized way for me to reference past knowledge in the case that I have forgotten (which happens more frequently than I would like)

## Philosophy (Forever Changing)

From time to time, my conscience may fixate upon a topic, either momentarily or semi-permanently, and I would gain a great desire to pursue such topic, in a state high with motivation. Yet, like a flame without fuel, the burn out is eventual, especially for more advanced fields that require significant time spent on grasping the theory and won't get into the fruitful applicable methodologies much later. And without a consolidated record, these moments of passion became lost to time, and ultimately became a waste of time for my long-term improvement as a scholar. This is the experimental solution that I have came up with. By keeping comprehensive records of all topics that I dive into, I can provide a sense of responsibility that can continue to fuel the fire. Further, all records will focus on applications, including thorough experimentations that I will conduct in the pursuit of this topic, while providing just enough foundational theory to appreciate the work at hand.

## The Process
1. Choose a topic and set a total expected time frame.
2. Conduct thorough research of topic and dump information onto paper.
3. Find existing applicable implementation of said topic or create your own application. Make sure to follow the Plan-Design-Prototype-Revise loop while documenting everything.
4. Compress all notes and documentation into a single page. This page will resemble a user manual and be as comprehensive as need be.
